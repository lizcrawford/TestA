What is Comcast Ventures?
* question/comcastbasic

< Comcast is an investor in Genacast. Genacast is not a strategic fund so companies we invest in don't have to have a relationship with Comcast or NBC Universal but if that is important we can open doors and make introductions as necessary. Our purpose is not to present acquisition opportunities to Comcast.
